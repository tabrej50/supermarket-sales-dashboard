# 📊 Supermarket Sales Analysis Dashboard

## 📁 Project Overview

This project is part of my **Data Analyst Internship Task 2: Data Visualization and Storytelling**, where the objective was to analyze a real-world sales dataset and create an interactive dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard visually presents trends, customer behavior, and performance metrics to help drive business decisions.

The dataset used contains supermarket sales data, including information about sales across different branches, product lines, payment methods, customer demographics, and more. This project focuses on transforming this raw data into meaningful insights through powerful visual storytelling.
